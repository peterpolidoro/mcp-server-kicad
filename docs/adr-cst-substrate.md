# CST substrate architecture: spike-verified decision records

Status: drafted 2026-08-09 from workflow `issue9-arch-spikes` (3 Opus-max spikes, each independently re-executed by an adversarial verifier; verdicts A: PARTIAL-confirmed, B: CONFIRMED, C: PARTIAL-confirmed; corrections folded in below). Spike artifacts: scratchpad `spike_a/ spike_b/ spike_c/ verify_a/ verify_b/ verify_c/`; CI evidence: branch `ci/issue9-kicad10-probe` commits `eb2c7a1`/`57230ab`, run 31303313193.

## The invariant (fixed, non-negotiable)

Bytes the user did not ask us to change reach the disk unchanged, and any edit we cannot do correctly is refused with the file intact.

## ADR-1: the write substrate is a byte-preserving CST

**Decision.** A stdlib-only lossless concrete-syntax-tree module (`mcp_server_kicad/_cst.py`) becomes the substrate for file mutation. Bytes in, bytes out; whitespace and EOLs preserved; edits are node splices.

**Evidence.** Round-trip byte-identity 15,711/15,711 files, 423 MB (all stock symbol libs, all 15,415 stock footprints, KiCad 6/7/8 demo saves, fork testdata); verifier reproduced exactly and extended to 596 further files (594/596, see policy below). Splices preserve 100% of bytes outside the edited region and are semantically taken up by KiCad (ERC violation deltas, netlist net renames, DRC item-count changes on boards). Parse+serialize of the 2.4 MB Device.kicad_sym: ~1.07 s.

**Policies the spikes forced:**
- **Escape codec is the only lossy surface.** KiCad's contract, measured against its writers: unescape `\\ \" \n \r \t`, keep the backslash on unknown escapes, re-escape `\ " LF CR` on write, TAB emitted raw. Raw LF inside a quoted atom is a KiCad hard reject; BOM is a KiCad hard reject. The escape probe stays in the tree as a per-KiCad-version regression test. (kiutils gets this wrong today: it corrupts `\\` and `\n` payloads on read.)
- **Malformed input policy: refuse loudly.** KiCad's reader silently repairs broken files; its own 9.0.8 installer ships two malformed demos (unbalanced parens) that KiCad opens and the CST rejects. Consequence one: `kicad-cli` rc=0 proves loadability, never well-formedness, so byte-level checks stay the primary oracle in tests. Consequence two: the CST raises a positioned syntax error instead of guessing; same philosophy as the version guard.
- **Bytes-only I/O.** Text-mode reads silently rewrote every CRLF in a 5.9 MB board during spike B's first attempt. Inserted spans copy the EOL/indent of their anchor sibling (`insert_after(ref, node, sep=reuse)`), which is all the pretty-printing the substrate needs.

**Node API (everything the spikes needed, nothing more):** `parse(bytes) -> Node`, `serialize(Node) -> bytes`, `head / atoms / lists / find / find_all`, `atom.set_text`, `list.copy`, `parent.insert_after(ref, node, sep=None)`, `text` decode-on-demand.

**Open engineering debt, with a number attached:** prototype memory is 35-40x file size (222 MB for a 6 MB board). Production repr must fold separators into leaves or use a flat token array; kill criterion: if the hardened repr cannot hold the 6 MB Video board under ~10x, revisit the design before migrating board tools.

**Not building:** a typed full-file model, a pretty-printer, format documentation.

## ADR-2: new constructs come from harvested templates

**Decision.** Constructs the server creates are stamped from templates harvested from KiCad's own upgrade output (golden files), with parameter slots identified by differential inference: vary one input, upgrade the pair, diff atoms, classify IDENTITY / DERIVED / REFORMAT; noise (uuids) learned empirically from repeat runs, not by token name.

**Evidence.** Inference isolated exactly 1 slot among 226,984 atoms on the real Device library; handled one-input-to-many (symbol name fans into 3 atoms) and numeric reformatting; a stamped symbol survived two upgrade passes drift-free and rendered by name via `sym export svg`. Verifier re-ran the pipeline byte-identically and extended it unmodified to six untested constructs, including a property value containing escaped quotes, backslash, unicode, and spaces.

**Guardrails, each from a measured failure:**
1. Alignment must be content-keyed for lists KiCad sorts (pad `layers` produced a phantom slot under positional alignment).
2. Parameters that change structure (pad `smd` -> `thru_hole` adds `(drill …)`) are harvested as whole-subtree variants per value, never as atom slots.
3. Stamping must splice inside quote marks and encode through the ADR-1 codec; the prototype's `str.format` dropped quoting, so non-bareword values failed (closed, but failed).
4. Noise probes need n>=3 upgrade runs; content-derived ids (schematic hierarchy paths) must be classified explicitly, not assumed random.
5. **Board net references are version-gated with zero dialect overlap** (the sharpest spike-B result): `(net N)` in a KiCad 10 board is accepted and silently rebound by load order (a real miswire, measured: `(net 2)` landed on GND with no error), and `(net "NAME")` in a KiCad 9 board is a hard reject. Emit numeric nets for 9-format boards, named nets for 10+, and never copy a numeric net reference across versions. Schematic labels/wires, by contrast, overlap cleanly from KiCad 6 through 10 (verified: v6 file splice, EOF insertion, unicode and escaped payloads, all with netlist uptake).
6. sch/pcb harvesting needs the KiCad-10 CI runner (`sch upgrade`/`pcb upgrade` do not exist on 9; `pcb upgrade` also no-ops on current files, so re-serialization goldens come from `pcbnew.SaveBoard`). The first CI harvest must validate the noise probe on uuid-heavy sch/pcb output before templates from it are trusted. Also close there: the `.kicad_sch` writer escape contract (force a rewrite via `sch upgrade`), unverifiable locally on 9.

**Kill criterion.** If the CI harvest on sch/pcb shows noise indistinguishable from slots, fall back to hand-written emitters for those constructs; they still sit behind ADR-1 preservation, so the blast radius of a wrong emitter is one refused or wrong node, never a corrupted file.

## ADR-3: migration is a strangler fig by mutation-kind; the skeleton is add_label

**Decision.** kiutils (or the fork) remains the read layer. Write paths migrate one mutation-kind at a time; each migrated tool routes its save through CST splicing; unmigrated tools are untouched. Each slice is one PR, reverting cleanly, validated by (a) a byte-preservation test (everything outside the edited region unchanged), (b) the existing autouse ERC oracle, (c) the full suite, and (d) the now-gating KiCad 10 step on the macos runner (zero red baseline as of merge `a38f325`; validate pre-merge via a `ci/**` push, since that workflow does not run on PR branches).

**Walking skeleton: `add_label`.** Smallest RMW tool with full-stack value, and spike B proved its payload dialect is version-portable v6 through v10. The slice: `_cst.py` hardened from the spike prototype (leaner nodes, codec, malformed policy, escape self-check); `add_label` reimplemented as read-bytes -> CST -> splice template label -> write-bytes, kiutils-free on that path; tests for byte preservation, ERC uptake, and the corpus round-trip (stock libs swept on runners that have KiCad installed). Stretch, explicitly flagged: once CST-backed, `add_label` no longer needs the version guard for its write, because preservation holds by construction and the label dialect is portable; the guard then becomes a per-path capability check rather than a blanket refusal. That is the first user-visible payoff: a KiCad 10 user gets a working, safe edit before any parser grows KiCad 10 support.

**Order after the skeleton:** label/text family, then wires/junctions, then symbol placement (template harvest from CI), then board mutations last (they need ADR-2 guardrail 5 and the memory fix). Board side stays engine-ready: KiCad 11's headless `api-server` (~Feb-Mar 2027) slots in behind the same tool API.

**Kill criteria per slice:** byte-preservation test fails, ERC uptake missing, or the KiCad 10 gate goes red: revert the slice, keep the substrate.

## Standing corrections from verification (so the record stays honest)

- Spike A's "zero failures on real KiCad files" is scoped to well-formed files; KiCad-shipped malformed files exist and are refused by design.
- Spike A's spliced-file ERC delta is +2 violations (one dangling label, one multiple_net_names), not "3 items" as most naturally read.
- Spike C's counts were 8 fixture pairs / 32 harvest runs (7/8 fully explained), not 9/36; its "B" sizes were decoded character counts, not disk bytes.
- Spike B's KiCad-10 anchor-2 precedence case is inferred from the violation delta, proven only on KiCad 9.

## Status log

- 2026-08-09: slice 1 merged (CST substrate + byte-preserving add_label; kiutils retained for validation).
- 2026-08-09: slice 2: add_label made fully CST-native (page-size validation from the CST), which relaxes the version guard for exactly this path; KiCad 10 files get their first working edit. Every other tool keeps the guard. KiCad 10 e2e test mints a current-format schematic via sch upgrade on the gating macos runner.
- 2026-08-09: slice 3: add_global_label, add_hierarchical_label, add_text, add_junctions CST-native and guard-free, each with its own KiCad 10 mint-and-edit e2e on the gating runner. Native fidelity tokens (justify, fields_autoplaced, exclude_from_sim, Intersheetrefs, junction diameter) deliberately deferred: today's semantics preserved exactly.
- 2026-08-09: slice 4: removal/modify family (remove_label, remove_junction, remove_text, remove_hierarchical_label, modify_hierarchical_label) CST-native and guard-free via the new remove_child primitive. The whole schematic label/text/junction surface now runs on the substrate.
- 2026-08-09: slice 5: add_wires and remove_wire CST-native and guard-free, including a CST twin of the auto-junction pass (endpoints landing on wire interiors still get junctions). The schematic wire/label/text/junction surface is now fully on the substrate; wire_pins_to_net and no_connect tools stay kiutils for now (they need pin-position reads).
- 2026-08-09: slice 6: hybrid pattern for connect_pins, no_connect_pin, remove_no_connect: kiutils parse stays for pin-position reads only (guarded, never saved), every write is a CST splice. Byte preservation lands on KiCad 9 files; KiCad 10 capability waits for a K10-safe pin-read path. wire_pins_to_net deferred to the symbol slice: its auto-PWR_FLAG branch is a symbol placement (ADR-2).
- 2026-08-09: slice 7: CST-native pin reads (_get_pin_pos_cst walks placed symbols and lib_symbols, reusing the pure-math _transform_pin_pos; a differential test pins it to the kiutils path through rotation and mirror). The routing trio is now guard-free, single-parse, and KiCad-10-capable; the mint-and-edit e2e measures pin extraction against KiCad-10-shaped lib_symbols live. kiutils pin path remains for wire_pins_to_net and the symbol tools.
- 2026-08-09: slice 8: wire_pins_to_net CST-native and guard-free; the first symbol emission through the substrate: lib_symbols entries are VERBATIM CST copies of KiCad's own system-library nodes (no emission knowledge; a synthetic template only on hosts without KiCad), and the placed PWR_FLAG comes from a fixed native template with the instances-path resolution ported as-is. The whole routing surface now runs on the substrate; add_power_symbol/place_component are next and reuse this skeleton.
- 2026-08-09: slice 9: the in-place symbol family (add_lib_symbol via the generalized lib-copy, move_component, set_component_property, remove_component, set_page_size) CST-native and guard-free on the schematic. The root-instance helpers (_upsert/_remove_root_symbol_instance) stay kiutils, so the root-with-.kicad_pro case still re-serializes the root exactly as before. place_component (with its add_power_symbol wrapper) is the last kiutils writer in schematic.py.
- 2026-08-09: slice 10: place_component and add_power_symbol CST-native and guard-free (lib entries copied from system or custom .kicad_sym, placed node from a native template with per-placement pin splices and parent-instance entries read via CST). The root-instance and hierarchy-path helpers are rewritten on the CST, so root schematics are no longer re-serialized by kiutils on any schematic write. schematic.py has zero kiutils write paths; _RAW_LIB_SYMBOLS and the _save_sch patch machinery remain for project.py's sheet tools, the next frontier.
- 2026-08-09: slice 11: every project.py writer (create_schematic, hierarchical sheet CRUD, sheet pins, annotate, move/reorder, duplicate_sheet, flatten_hierarchy) CST-native and guard-free. The .kicad_sch write surface is 100% on the substrate; _save_sch and the _RAW_LIB_SYMBOLS text-patch band-aid are deleted; kiutils remains for reads and boards only. The guard-representative RMW test now tracks a board writer.
- 2026-08-09: slice 12A: hardened CST repr (whitespace folded into per-node sep slots, per-kind node classes with class-attr constants, parse-time token interning). Measured on real boards against the 37.4x baseline: 11.35x retained on the 6MB Video board (parse 1.5s vs 2.0s before; tokenize floor 0.51s), 8.85x on the 71MB vme-wren. ~11x is the floor of any one-object-per-token design in CPython (~32B object header + 33B bytes overhead per token; coordinates are mostly unique so interning cannot dedup them). GATE REVISED 10x -> 12x with the user's sign-off: 68MB for the benchmark board is acceptable for a server process, and board-tool conversion is unblocked. Two recorded follow-ups if real memory or latency pain appears: the flat-token-array design (~4x, ~2x faster parse, lazy node views over packed offset arrays) and an mtime-keyed parsed-tree cache (read-tools first, exception-drops-entry rule for writers; ships with the board slice).
- 2026-08-09: slice 12B: all 13 schematic read tools CST-native and guard-free; KiCad 10 schematics are now fully readable and writable through the schematic server. kiutils reads remain in project.py tools and boards; the guard-representative read test tracks project.get_symbol_instances.
- 2026-08-09: slice 13: boards enter the substrate. The generic node helpers moved into _cst.py (still zero package imports). The 8 board read tools (list_pcb_footprints/traces/nets/zones/layers/graphic_items, get_board_info, get_footprint_pads) are CST-native and guard-free, so KiCad 10 boards are readable; the strict issue #11 xfail on TestUpdatePcbE2E is deleted, with its two kiutils-writer dependencies restructured (pcbnew subprocess move; schematic-side stale footprint). Boards get an mtime keyed parsed-tree cache in _open_pcb_cst; writers pop their entry before mutating and never reinsert, so a mid-edit exception cannot leave a poisoned tree cached. First board writers add_trace and add_via splice native-shape nodes with version gated net emission per guardrail 5: numeric (net N) at or below 20241229, name-based quoted above it, and an unknown number against a KiCad 10 format board is refused with the file untouched. Items always carry (uuid ...); the local DRC test pins KiCad 9 accepting that inside tstamp-era boards, and the KiCad 10 emission shape rides the new net-binding e2e on the gating mac runner. kiutils keeps the geometry trio (check_placement, get_footprint_bounds, validate_board), every other board writer, and the project.py reads.
- 2026-08-10: slice 14: every remaining board writer is CST-native and guard-free (place/move/remove_footprint, add_pcb_text, add_pcb_line, add_copper_zone, add_keepout_zone, set_trace_width, remove_traces, add_thermal_vias, remove_dangling_tracks). move_footprint's keepout and edge warnings run on CST twins of the geometry checks (the pure edge chaining extracted as _chain_edge_polygon), so they fire on KiCad 10 boards where the kiutils path silently skipped them. Zone templates follow measured native shapes: solid connect is (connect_pads yes ...), measured on pcbnew 9 locally (kiutils' full is a dialect KiCad never writes), and the KiCad 10 zone dialect, measured by the slice-14 probe on the mac runner, is name-only (net "NAME") with no net_name and no filled_areas_thickness on copper zones and no net tokens at all on rule areas; emission is version gated accordingly and pcbnew's ZONE_FILLER acceptance e2e guards it on both majors. _find_net and _filter_segments are deleted. kiutils keeps the geometry trio reads, autoroute internals, and project.py reads; the guard-representative RMW test tracks symbol.add_symbol.
- 2026-08-10: slice 16: the six project.py reads (validate_hierarchy, list_hierarchy, get_sheet_info, trace_hierarchical_net, list_cross_sheet_nets, get_symbol_instances) are CST-native and guard-free, so a KiCad 10 hierarchy is now readable as well as writable. _load_sch and its kiutils Schematic import are deleted along with _find_sheet and the dead _collect_refs, which leaves the whole .kicad_sch surface, reads and writes, on the substrate. Parity was measured rather than assumed: old and new results were dumped as JSON over the missing child, direction mismatch, orphaned pin, unannotated ref, global label and cross sheet branches and diffed, identical apart from random uuids. The guard-representative read test is retired instead of repointed, because no schematic tool refuses on version any more; symbol.list_lib_symbols and footprint.get_footprint_info carry the standing read-refusal coverage on the permanent guarded surface. A mint-and-read e2e on the gating mac runner is the slice's proof, the first e2e these tools have had. kiutils now survives only in the symbol and footprint library tools (including create_symbol_library), the pcb.py autoroute internals, and the board geometry trio until the slice converting it lands.
- 2026-08-10: slice 17: the symbol and footprint library tools (list_lib_symbols, get_symbol_info, add_symbol, project.create_symbol_library, get_footprint_info) are CST-native and guard-free, so a KiCad 10 .kicad_sym and .kicad_mod are readable and a KiCad 10 library is writable. add_symbol is now a splice: everything outside the new symbol reaches disk unchanged, and the version stamp of an existing library is never touched, so a 20251024 file stays 20251024. Emission follows ADR-2: both templates are verbatim kicad-cli sym upgrade output from KiCad 9.0.8, measured locally, replacing a kiutils dialect KiCad never writes. What the harvest showed: version 20241209 with a quoted (generator "kicad_symbol_editor") plus (generator_version "9.0"), tab indent, properties with no (id N), (hide yes) inside effects instead of a bare hide, an (effects (font (size 1.27 1.27))) block on every pin name and number, and the (exclude_from_sim no) and (embedded_fonts no) shape tokens. Two measured behaviors are copied rather than guessed: KiCad writes (pin_names (offset X)) only when the offset differs from its 0.508 mm default and strips the token at the default, and it adds a (property "Description" "") that add_symbol has no input for and therefore does not emit. The pin_names_offset parameter now lands at all, which fixes a silent drop: kiutils emitted pin_names only when its unused pinNames flag was set, so the parameter had been a documented no-op. A kicad-cli sym upgrade acceptance test is the new oracle for written libraries, the suite having had none for .kicad_sym. The two vestigial .kicad_sym guard calls in schematic.py go with them, along with _shared._courtyard_bbox (replaced by the CST twin moved in from pcb.py, together with _xy and _keepout_dict) and the dead _fp_val. _check_format_version now has exactly one production caller, _load_board, so the guard exists solely to keep the autoroute internals off a KiCad 10 board; the machinery and the system-library carve-out stay for that path, and pcb.py still version-gates net emission off the limits dict. Read parity was measured over the stock corpus rather than assumed: 21,369 symbols in 223 libraries through both implementations, zero differences in pin counts, coordinates, ordering or property order, and every text difference a kiutils defect the CST fixes. 1,110 symbols had non-ASCII text kiutils decodes as latin-1; three had an escaped backslash in a datasheet path that kiutils doubled; one had its name truncated, because kiutils reads Raspberry_Pi_2_3 as Raspberry_Pi with unit 2 style 3 and then cannot find it again; and two libraries, Converter_DCDC and RF, crash kiutils outright on Windows and now read. kiutils in the tool surface is now autoroute support only.
- 2026-08-10: slice 15: the geometry trio (check_placement, get_footprint_bounds, validate_board) is CST-native and guard-free, so a KiCad 10 board answers placement, bounds and validation queries instead of being refused at the version guard. The kiutils geometry helpers go with them: _board_edge_polygon, _check_footprint_keepout_violations and _keepout_restrictions are deleted, replaced by _keepout_violations_cst (the dict-producing core that move_footprint's boolean check now folds into) and _courtyard_bbox_cst, with list_pcb_zones sharing the one keepout restriction dict. Output shapes are unchanged, including the fixed plural in "N violations found". Coverage: the retired helpers' unit tests are ported onto the CST twins, a K10-header run of each tool is pinned to the K9 run of identical geometry, and a new e2e runs all three against a pcbnew-written board with stock-library courtyards on both CI majors. kiutils inside pcb.py is now confined to the autoroute internals (_load_board for trace counts and the displaced-text fix). Slice 16 having landed first, those autoroute internals plus the symbol and footprint library tools are the whole remaining kiutils surface.
- 2026-08-10: slice 18: the last three kiutils jobs, all inside autoroute_pcb, are CST twins, so the strangler fig is complete and no production module imports kiutils at all. Trace and via counts are top-level head counts, with arcs excluded exactly as the kiutils isinstance scan excluded them (its Arc is a separate class, not a Segment subclass). The displaced-text fix widened deliberately while moving: it now resets (property "Reference"/"Value" ...) nodes as well as (fp_text <type> ...) ones, because pcbnew 7 and newer store those two fields as properties, so on a board pcbnew itself had written the kiutils version reached user texts and nothing else. Rotation atoms survive, the 5 mm threshold and the default offsets are unchanged, and the file is rewritten only when something moved. Keepout promotion copies each footprint keepout zone once per polygon, transforms the points into board coordinates and splices the result among the board zones, with net tokens dialect-gated per guardrail 5: numeric (net 0) with an empty net_name at or below 20241229, none at all above it, which is the measured K10 rule-area shape add_keepout_zone already emitted. All three parse fresh rather than through the board cache. With _load_board gone the guard machinery goes with it: _check_format_version, both header regexes, _FORMAT_VERSION_LIMITS and the system-library carve-out that existed only to let stock KiCad 10 libraries past the refusal. No tool refuses a file on its format version any more. The one gate that was reading the limits dict for something other than refusing, net emission, relocates to pcb.py as _NUMERIC_NET_VERSION_MAX with the same value. kiutils moves to the dev extra: it still builds test fixtures and reads written files back as an independent oracle, but the runtime wheel no longer depends on it, verified in a scratch venv where kiutils is absent, all five servers import and the unified server still registers 109 tools; test_runtime_imports_no_kiutils scans the package source so a new import cannot slip back in unnoticed, the suite being unable to notice it. autoroute_pcb no longer refuses a KiCad 10 board; what it still needs is a pcbnew whose era matches the board, because the DSN export and the SES import ride pcbnew, and that surfaces through the existing _export_dsn error path rather than a version check of ours. Issue #9 can close.
- 2026-08-10: autoroute era preflight. autoroute_pcb now resolves the pcbnew major before it starts, through a one-shot "import pcbnew; print(pcbnew.Version())" against the interpreter find_pcbnew_python already picks, and compares it with the board format version, which comes free from the parse that counts traces. A KiCad 10 board against a pcbnew 9 is refused up front, naming both versions and KICAD_PYTHON, which supersedes slice 18's note that the mismatch surfaces only through the _export_dsn error path: it does not any more, it surfaces before the board leaves for a subprocess. The other direction routes and returns a warning on the new AutorouteResult.warnings list, because pcbnew's SaveBoard writes the routed copy in the running pcbnew's format, so a KiCad 9 board comes back as a KiCad 10 file; the original board is untouched in both directions. The version API was measured rather than assumed, on KiCad 9.0.8: Version(), GetBuildVersion(), FullVersion(), GetSemanticVersion() and GetMajorMinorPatchVersion() all answer "9.0.8" and GetMajorMinorVersion() answers "9.0". Any probe failure, missing interpreter, failing subprocess or unreadable output, returns None and the tool behaves exactly as it did before, so the probe cannot become a failure mode of its own. Its unmocked test is the cross-era proof: real pcbnew 9 on the Linux runner, real pcbnew 10 on the gating macOS one.
- 2026-08-10: path policy, recorded so it is not re-litigated. The 2026-08-10 tool-definition audit raised that caller-supplied write destinations accept any absolute path, and the first plan was a shared validator confining them to the project root with a `KICAD_ALLOW_ANY_PATH` opt-out. That was rejected on four grounds, all checked against the code rather than argued. `create_project` exists to create a project where none exists and calls `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`, so confining it to the project root is incoherent for the tool whose job is to make the root. In exactly that case there is no root to confine to: with no `.kicad_pro` in cwd, `_resolve_config` yields empty strings for every path. `KICAD_OUTPUT_DIR` is a documented, shipped feature whose entire purpose is sending exports elsewhere, so confinement fights the configuration users are told to set. And it protects the wrong thing: the schematic, board and libraries all live inside the root, so it blocks `~/.ssh/config` and leaves `board.kicad_sch` fully exposed, inverting the value ordering. An `ALLOW_ANY_PATH` escape hatch is also set once on first friction and never unset. What was taken instead is the one piece that is unambiguously worth it: `remove_hierarchical_sheet`'s `child_path.unlink()` is the only delete primitive in the package, it is reached through the `Sheetfile` property and so through file content, and deleting is strictly worse than overwriting; it now refuses when the resolved path leaves the parent's directory, and refuses before writing so the parent survives too. `child_path.exists()` became `is_file()` in the same change, since an empty `Sheetfile` resolved to the parent directory itself. The better future axis is refuse-to-clobber rather than confine-by-location: it targets the actual harm, catches `~/.ssh/config`, `sym-lib-table` and `board.kicad_sch` alike, and matches the invariant at the top of this document. Its honest cost is that re-exporting to the same path is the normal loop, so it needs an `overwrite` parameter on every export tool, which is why it is sequenced after the annotation fixes rather than instead of them. Rate limiting and access controls, also MUSTs in the MCP tools security section, are deliberately not implemented: this is a stdio server whose only client is its parent process, running as the user with the same filesystem rights, so there is no second caller to limit and no boundary to enforce.
- 2026-08-10: atomic writes, which is the half of the invariant the substrate never implemented. The line at the top of this document promises that an edit we cannot do correctly is refused with the file intact, and ADR-2's kill criterion repeats it: the blast radius of a wrong emitter is one refused or wrong node, never a corrupted file. Every write was `Path(x).write_bytes(_cst.serialize(tree))`, which opens with O_TRUNC, so the promise only ever covered failures caught before the write began. Disk-full, a killed process, a scanner locking the file, power loss: each left a truncated file. Measured rather than argued, on NTFS with three readers against one writer, the plain write was observed torn 345 times in 800 reads and every torn size included zero bytes, so a reader saw an empty schematic; the same probe against a temp-plus-`os.replace` variant saw 0 tears in 25,529 reads, and even with readers spaced 100 ms apart the plain write tore 36 of 81 reads. `_shared._atomic_write` writes a sibling temp and replaces it over the destination, and all 55 direct writes now route through it. The three sites originally exempted as generated output, the autoroute temp board, the routed board and the cached freerouting jar, were swapped too: a torn jar is no better than a torn schematic, and with zero exceptions the rule becomes mechanically checkable instead of depending on marker comments staying accurate, which is what `test_every_write_goes_through_atomic_write` scans the source for. Four decisions inside the helper, each from a measured or already-recorded failure. The temp suffix goes after the whole name (`board.kicad_sch.1234.tmp`), because `board.tmp.kicad_sch` is swept up both by `_resolve_config`'s `*.kicad_pro` scan and by the suite's rglob. A blocked replace retries for about 0.75 s and then raises with the file intact, never falling back to a direct write: Windows refuses the swap while another process holds the destination open, which is exactly the moment a fallback would tear the file the retry existed to protect. The error names the destination and never the temp, because this project has already lost time to a Defender message naming a path the user did not recognise, and a temp is precisely such a path. And there is deliberately no fsync, said in the docstring so it does not read as an oversight: tearing is what was measured, the replace closes it completely, and power-loss durability has not been measured as a need here. Atomicity is a POSIX guarantee and, per CPython's own `os.replace` documentation, only that; on Windows it is `MoveFileEx` behaviour rather than a contract and on SMB it depends on the server, but in every one of those cases it is still strictly better than truncate-then-write, because the original is only ever replaced whole. Per-file atomicity is where this stops. One tool call can still write two files and a failure on the second leaves them disagreeing, which `TestFanOutResidual` pins as an executable statement rather than a paragraph: with the index write failing, the payload is whole, parseable and carries the new symbol, and the index simply never got its entry. Closing that would need a journal with crash recovery at startup and an orphaned-journal policy, to protect against a stale entry in an index KiCad rewrites on its next save. What the fan-out did get is ordering and batching. `add_hierarchical_sheet` wrote the root once per child symbol and only then the child, committing a derived index before its payload, and now writes the child first and the root once. `annotate_schematic` re-parsed and rewrote the entire root schematic per annotated symbol, which at the 1.07 s parse this document measures for a 2.4 MB file made a fifty-symbol sheet fifty parses, fifty serializes and fifty chances to fail; it is now one of each, through a pure `_upsert_entry` that touches no disk. Two clobbers went in the same change, because atomic writes turn them from sometimes-destructive into reliably-destructive: `duplicate_sheet` copied over an existing destination unchecked, and `flatten_hierarchy` wrote a caller-supplied `output_path` unchecked while promising in its docstring not to modify the original hierarchy. The second guard is deliberately narrow, refusing only when the output is one of the files being flattened, because a bare exists check would break re-flattening to the same output and the path-policy entry above records that refuse-to-clobber in general needs an `overwrite` parameter first. Four writes stay outside the guarantee because a subprocess performs them: `sym upgrade`, `fp upgrade`, and `pcbnew.SaveBoard` in both `fill_zones` and the netlist import. `fp upgrade` is the sharpest, rewriting every `.kicad_mod` in a library in place with no undo; a pre-write copy was rejected as a backup with no lifecycle owner, in favour of saying so on the tool and pointing at version control. Windows finally has a runner. `windows.yml` mirrors `macos-discovery.yml`'s trigger and installs KiCad, because the install-folder probe had only ever been tested against synthetic directory trees, and because all three Windows faults this work touched, kicad-cli off PATH, Controlled Folder Access killing it at startup, and the torn write, reached a user before any CI could have seen them.
- 2026-08-12: output validity, the other half of the invariant. The atomic-writes entry above closed durability: bytes arrive whole or not at all. Nothing checked whether the whole file was any good, so an intact unloadable file reached the disk unopposed, which is the same promise broken from the other side. Measured by running kicad-cli against the output rather than reasoned about: `add_trace(layer="banana")` wrote `(layer banana)` and the board then failed to load with rc 3, and `place_component(rotation=37)` did the same to a schematic; `add_pcb_text`, `add_pcb_line` and `place_footprint` shared the layer defect and `add_label` the rotation one. Fourteen parameters, one missing guarantee. Patching per parameter is O(parameters) and had already failed twice: `format` got an enum and a source-scanning guard, then `mirror` and `output_units` walked past it because the guard keyed on the parameter *name*, and `layer` and `rotation` walked past it the same way. The CST cannot help here, because `(layer banana)` is a perfectly well-formed s-expression and is wrong only in KiCad's semantics; a general output validator would need a model of what KiCad considers legal, which ADR-1 puts under *Not building*. So validation happens at the point of construction, where the knowledge already sits. Layer is checked against the board's own `(layers ...)` table, since the legal set is per-board and users rename layers, which makes this a cross-reference inside the document being edited rather than an external schema; `_resolve_layer_cst` is modelled on `_resolve_net_cst`, which had been doing exactly this for nets one line above the unvalidated `set_text(layer)` in `add_copper_zone`. Only `atoms[1]` counts, because a row may carry a fourth atom holding a display alias, and copper is tested by the `.Cu` suffix rather than the row's type atom, because KiCad writes `power`, `mixed` and `jumper` for inner copper and a type test would reject a legal power plane. Rotation is the closed set 0/90/180/270. `_fill_at` is the only rotation writer in the package, but it is shared with `pcb.py` where arbitrary angles are legal, `get_footprint_bounds` carrying the trig over four rotated corners that only exists for non-orthogonal angles, so the guard sits at the six schematic call sites and at `symbol.py`'s pin writer, not in `_fill_at`. Why it went unnoticed is the more useful half. The oracle already existed and was correct: the autouse fixture runs every generated `.kicad_sch` through kicad-cli, detecting refusal by the absence of the report file, which is exactly how rc 3 surfaces. It only ever saw values a test author typed, it did not glob `*.kicad_pcb` at all, and at `TestInvalidRotation` it had been switched off on purpose with `no_kicad_validation` so a schematic carrying a 45-degree angle could be asserted correct. All 16 uses of that marker were audited: 9 in `test_cst.py` are legitimate, 5 suppress hand-built fixtures, and that class was the only place a tool writing an invalid file was blessed. The fix is therefore two guards and one property, no input may produce a file KiCad cannot open, meaning the tool refuses or what it writes still loads, never a third outcome. Boards joined the oracle through `kicad-cli pcb drc` on the same absence-of-report signal and the same content-digest memo, which needed a generation gate: a KiCad 9 kicad-cli cannot open a KiCad 10 board and that is not a defect, so without the gate the oracle reported 26 false failures on a KiCad 9 machine, every one a K10 fixture; boards stamped past the K9 ceiling are skipped when the resolved binary is older, so they are still validated on the macOS and Windows runners. `test_output_validity.py` is the hostile-value half, taking parameters from the live signature rather than a list precisely because a name-scoped list is what let the first four through, feeding type-appropriate values so that 37 into a `list[str]` parameter does not test pydantic and bury the signal, and asserting each baseline call succeeds first, since a tool erroring for an unrelated reason would make every hostile value "refused" and the sweep would pass while measuring nothing. It earned itself on the first run: `add_global_label` had never validated `shape` while `add_hierarchical_label` had always checked the same vocabulary, so `shape="banana"` reached the file and kicad-cli refused the schematic. Proven non-vacuous by removing the layer guard from `add_trace` and watching the sweep go red. Costs: the sweep about 10s, the board oracle about 8s on a full run, 47s against 40s. What is deliberately still outside: the four subprocess writers, unchanged from the atomic-writes entry, and `check_placement.rotation`, which is accepted and never read, a no-op parameter rather than a corruption and filed on its own.
- 2026-08-12: the two findings the entry above deferred are fixed rather than filed, which supersedes its closing sentence. `check_placement` took a `rotation` it never read: both of its checks are on the footprint's origin point, and rotating about the origin cannot move the origin, so no angle could ever have changed either answer. The parameter is removed rather than wired up, because wiring it up means switching the tool from a point test to a courtyard test, which is a different tool with a different answer and belongs in its own change; the docstring now says the check is origin-based so the absence of a rotation input reads as a decision instead of an omission. No caller in the suite, the skills, or the README passed it, so nothing needed updating alongside. `move_footprint`'s placement checks stay advisory, since moving into a keep-out or off the board edge is legal KiCad and merely usually a mistake, but two things about them changed. They now run before `_atomic_write` rather than after, so a fault in the geometry helpers cannot leave a moved footprint on disk with nothing said about it; the checks read the already-mutated tree, so the answers are identical either side of the write. And the `except Exception: pass` that swallowed any such fault now appends a warning naming the exception, which keeps the guarantee that validation never blocks the move while ending the silence that let a defect in those helpers stay invisible for as long as nobody went looking. Both are pinned: one test asserts the parameter is gone from the signature and the published schema and that passing it raises, the other forces the keepout check to throw and asserts the move still lands, the file still changes, and the failure is reported.
- 2026-08-14: the library upgrades get one backup each, which reverses this document's own 2026-08-10 decision. That entry rejected "a pre-write copy" for `sym upgrade` and `fp upgrade` as "a backup with no lifecycle owner, in favour of saying so on the tool and pointing at version control", and the saying-so shipped: both docstrings carry the warning today. What changed is not the objection, which was correct about what it was aimed at, but the proposal. What was rejected is an unbounded set of copies that somebody eventually has to sweep; what landed is exactly one backup per library, at a deterministic sibling path, overwritten on every run. There is no lifecycle to own because the count cannot grow, and the tool result names the path so it is discoverable rather than a surprise found later. `fp upgrade` remains the sharpest of the four subprocess writers, rewriting every `.kicad_mod` in a library at once, which is why it is the one that most wanted this. A failed backup refuses the upgrade rather than proceeding without one, since proceeding is the thing being prevented and whatever stopped the copy would very likely have made the rewrite worse. The `.pretty` case copies to a staging directory beside the library and swaps it into place, so an interrupted copy cannot leave a partial backup standing where a whole one used to be; the file case goes through `_atomic_write` and compares bytes in its test, because a backup that normalises line endings is not a backup. What this does not close, and is not claimed to: whether kicad-cli truncates those files in place or writes them atomically is still unmeasured, so the torn-write exposure `_atomic_write` exists for is mitigated by the copy rather than removed. The concurrent-reader probe this document already describes would answer it.
- 2026-08-14: what the four subprocess writers actually cost, measured rather than assumed, and what changed because of it. The entries above name those four as exceptions to *atomicity*; nothing in this repo had ever drawn the other consequences, and the README told users "none of them rewrites bytes you did not ask to change" with `autoroute_pcb` as the single caveat, described as "not about the file format". Ten parallel investigations with adversarial verification measured it. `pcbnew.SaveBoard` is not a reformat: it drops data. Two losses survived a skeptic re-running them. Coincident-geometry `PCB_SHAPE`s are de-duplicated at save, because the writer builds a `std::set` ordered by `shape->Compare()` which ignores the UUID: five `gr_line`s with two coincident pairs come out as three, and `vme-wren` goes 554 to 552. And every `fp_text` carrying `(hide yes)` is destroyed at *load*, 32 to 0 on `vme-wren`, from a KiCad 9 parser that constructs a `PCB_FIELD` and then has no default arm to add it; that one is fixed in KiCad 10 and was never backported. Two further claimed losses did not survive: `plotinvisibletext` is a token KiCad's own parser marks "no longer supported", and the `property "Footprint"` values dropped on an 8.99 upgrade were byte-identical to the libid that survived. The loss that actually reaches users needs no version mismatch at all: `fill_zones` on KiCad's own shipped `multichannel_mixer-unrouted` took it from version 20241030 to 20241229 in place, dropped 114 footprint property UUIDs, renamed user layers, and returned `status="ok"`. Two clusters disagreed on severity and both were right about their own boards: deletions need hidden `fp_text` or coincident shapes to be present, the format churn needs a stamp below the running pcbnew, and only the byte churn is universal (on Windows a no-op round trip converts all 760 line endings LF to CRLF). One mitigating fact confirmed twice: the damage is one-shot, since pcbnew is a fixpoint on its own output, byte-identical on passes 2 and 3 across 18 of 18 demos. What changed: both in-place writers refuse a board the running pcbnew cannot load, naming both versions in autoroute's own words rather than the 700 characters of wx chatter ending in a `NoneType` attribute error that they produced before; both compare the version stamp across the subprocess and report an upgrade, because it cannot be predicted (pcbnew reports its major, never the stamp it writes, and the measured corruption is inside one era on both sides); both docstrings say what the tool does to the file, which on an MCP server is the description a model reads before deciding to call; and the README and this file say it too. A refusal on the cross-era case was considered and rejected on four grounds, recorded so it is not re-litigated: it would miss the measured corruption entirely, it would make `fill_zones` unusable for any KiCad 10 user with an older board, the result is a valid openable board rather than the truncation class atomic writes exist for, and this document had already ruled on these two tools by name. An `allow_format_upgrade` parameter was rejected for the reason the path-policy entry gives about escape hatches, with the added twist that the caller here is a model that would read the parameter name straight out of the error text. Still unmeasured, and the reason a KiCad 10 probe exists: whether pcbnew 10 drops the same things, whether it upgrades a KiCad 9 board in place, whether `--check-zones` leaves the board byte-identical as documented, and whether the two demo boards that crash pcbnew's bindings on Windows do so anywhere else.
- 2026-08-14: the KiCad 10 probe, run twice on the macOS and Windows runners from a `ci/**` branch that was never merged, which is why its findings live here rather than in a workflow file. Every KiCad 10 statement in the entry above was a source or docs read; these are measurements. Confirmed on both platforms: pcbnew 10 upgrades a KiCad 9 board's format stamp IN PLACE through a bare LoadBoard plus SaveBoard, 20241229 to 20260206. That had only been inferred from the same mechanism one major down, and it is the strongest argument for ever moving `fill_zones` off pcbnew. Confirmed: pcbnew 10 de-duplicates coincident `PCB_SHAPE`s at save exactly as 9 does, five `gr_line`s with two coincident pairs coming out as three, so the 10.0 source read was right. Confirmed: pcbnew 10 is a fixpoint on its own output, passes 2 and 3 byte-identical on all six boards swept while pass 1 differs, so the damage stays one-shot. Confirmed, and load-bearing for any splice design: zone uuids survive a round trip intact, 1 of 1 on every board carrying a zone, so a zone in a pcbnew-written copy can be matched back to a zone in the user's board. Resolved in KiCad's favour: hidden `fp_text` is NOT destroyed on KiCad 10, counts holding at 30/30, 54/54 and 50/50 across the sweep, which measures the fix the 10.0 parser source claimed and confirms the KiCad 9 bug was never backported rather than never existing. New and immediately useful: `kicad-cli pcb export gerbers --check-zones` does what its documentation says, rc 0, gerbers produced, board byte-identical. That is the governing invariant exactly and is the right long-term answer for the unfilled-zone note on KiCad 10. Also new: `HasFilledPolysForLayer` must be asked before `GetFilledPolysList`, which otherwise asserts and kills the process ("m_FilledPolysList.count( aLayer ) failed"), and on a freshly loaded board that carries `filled_polygon` data in the file it answers False. pcbnew does not hand back stored fills on load, so any compute-there-write-here design has to run the filler rather than read it. Two answers turned out to be facts about the environment rather than about KiCad: no `filled_polygon` on any of the 19 boards KiCad 10 ships carries an `island` child at all, so the island-dialect worry is moot on this evidence, and the macOS cask ships no demo boards whatsoever, so that leg could only answer the section built from a synthesized board. Finally the crash, which settles a disagreement between two investigators in favour of the first: three of the 19 shipped boards kill pcbnew 10's bindings on `LoadBoard` on a fresh Windows runner (RoyalBlue54L-Feather, tinytapeout-demo, jetson-agx-thor-baseboard), so it is board-driven and not an artifact of one developer's machine. With the wxApp prelude they exit 0xC0000409 in about a second; without it they TIMEOUT, which is the modal dialog nobody is there to dismiss. That is the prelude working as designed, converting an indefinite hang into a fast diagnosable failure. It does not make those boards loadable, and nothing here does. Method note worth keeping: the probe's first run produced three vacuous answers that looked like findings, an island scan matching `island_area_min`, a hidden-text count that read 0 to 0 because it counted only one of two spellings and skipped `(property ...)` entirely, and a macOS leg that found no boards. A vacuous answer is worse than no answer, and the fix was to correct the instrument and run it again rather than to report what it said.
- 2026-08-14: fill_zones stops letting pcbnew write, which closes the largest of the four subprocess exceptions, and move_footprint stops half-flipping. The zone tool now hands pcbnew the board read-only, takes back the computed polygons as data, splices them into the caller's own file through the CST and writes with `_atomic_write`. pcbnew never calls SaveBoard, so the two losses measured on it cannot reach the file and neither can the in-place format upgrade: what lands is the original with its zones' fills replaced and every other byte, including the version stamp and the layer names, untouched. The emitted shape is harvested rather than invented, per the rule this document already sets: one `filled_polygon` node per outline per layer (a zone on `interf_u` carries 23), one `(pts ...)` child, coordinates at one to six decimal places with trailing zeros stripped, and `(xy ...)` tokens packed to a 99 column limit rather than one per line; the generated node round-trips through the CST byte for byte. Three details are load-bearing and each was measured rather than assumed. The splice replaces a zone's existing `filled_polygon` children rather than appending, because a zone filled before still carries last time's polygons and appending would double its copper, which no oracle in this suite would catch; removing that turns a test red. Zone uuids are the key, which the KiCad 10 probe confirmed survive a round trip on both majors. And `HasFilledPolysForLayer` is asked before `GetFilledPolysList`, which otherwise asserts and kills the process, also found by that probe. A digest check between the read and the splice refuses a board that changed underneath rather than writing another run's copper into it. `zones_filled` changes meaning and the old number was wrong: it counted zones handed to the filler, keepouts included, and keepouts are rule areas that never fill, so the acceptance test had been asserting 2 on a board with one copper zone and one keepout. Separately, and found while measuring for that work: `move_footprint(layer=...)` accepted the opposite side and rewrote only the footprint's own layer atom, leaving pads on F.Cu, F.Paste and F.Mask and texts on F.SilkS, so KiCad read a bottom-side part with top-side copper and kicad-cli loaded it happily. Moving to the other side is a flip, with a wide surface (arcs, polys, custom pad primitives, embedded zones, 3D model blocks), and this tool has never performed one; it is refused with the file intact and names what a flip involves. Two tests were pinning that defect, the same shape as the 45-degree rotation recorded above, including the output-validity baseline, where a baseline that raises would have made every hostile value in the sweep read as "refused" while measuring nothing. What remains outside the invariant is now three subprocess writers rather than four: `update_pcb_from_schematic`, whose dominant churn on a KiCad 9 board is pcbnew's own net renumbering rather than formatting, and the two library upgrades, which take a bounded backup first.
- 2026-08-14: the footprint flip, measured then implemented, which closes the defect the entry above could only refuse. `move_footprint(layer=...)` had accepted the opposite side and rewritten the footprint's own layer atom alone; what a flip actually is came from a probe on the macOS runner against a stock Resistor_SMD footprint through pcbnew's own `Flip(pos, FLIP_DIRECTION_LEFT_RIGHT)`. The transform: the footprint's layer crosses sides, its position is unchanged and its angle becomes `(180 - angle) % 360`, every layer token maps `F.x` to `B.x` and back while `*.Cu` is left alone, every local Y is negated (pad `at`, graphic `start`/`end`/`mid`/`center`, `pts`, text `at`) with X untouched, and text effects gain `(justify mirror)`. Local Y with the angle carrying the rest is what makes it a left-right flip in board space at any orientation. Two probe attempts measured the wrong thing before this one, and both mistakes are cheap to repeat. The first rotated the part 90 degrees, where `(180 - 90)` is 90, so the angle rule was invisible and a board-space left-right flip read as a Y negation in local coordinates. The second paired items by index, and negating Y swaps the two symmetric silkscreen lines that KiCad then re-sorts, so a changed file read as unchanged; the lesson is that nothing can be compared positionally across a file whose order KiCad is free to change, and the working probe prints both sides verbatim instead. A footprint carrying a construct whose flip has not been measured, custom pad primitives, an embedded zone or a 3D model block, is still refused with the file intact, because mirroring everything around one of those and leaving it alone is worse than not moving the footprint. The double-flip test is the strongest check available without pcbnew on the development machine, which cannot load this repo's own fixtures at all, and it earned itself on the first run: the implementation added `(justify mirror)` and never removed it, so a flip to the back and straight to the front left every text carrying a justification it never had. It toggles now, and breaking the angle rule, the Y mirror or the layer mirror each turns a test red on its own.
- 2026-08-14: the bundle icon, and how it is derived, recorded because the next person to update the logo will need it. The MCPB manifest schema has always had an `icon` field and this bundle set none, so Claude Desktop drew a default tile; adding it raised the question of why the mark read smaller than every icon beside it. Measured on `.github/assets/logo.png`: the white glyph occupies (50,66) to (461,445) inside 512x512, so about 12% of the canvas is dead border before the host adds its own tile padding, and the file is PNG colour type 2, meaning no alpha, with near-black baked across 65% of it. The second is the sharper problem, because Desktop has a light theme and an opaque near-black icon renders there as a black sticker while every neighbour adapts. What is NOT a packaging problem, and was checked before assuming otherwise: the mark is line art at 18% ink coverage, and the icons it sits beside (Notion, Linear, Slack, Figma) are solid high-coverage shapes, some of them proportionally smaller than ours. They read heavier because they are heavier. Stroke weight is a design decision and was left alone. So the bundle icon is derived rather than copied: crop a square around the glyph bounding box with 10% breathing room, resize to 512, then map luminance to alpha (below 40 fully transparent, ramping to opaque by 160) keeping the mark white. The result fills 91% of the tile by 83%, sits on the host's own background in either theme, and is 9 kB against the original's 100 kB. `mcpb pack` archives one directory and cannot reach outside it, so the file has to live in `mcpb/`; the byte-identity test that guarded the earlier straight copy is replaced by two that check the properties the derivation exists for, alpha present and the file small enough not to be an uncropped opaque image, both stdlib so the suite gains no imaging dependency.

- 2026-08-14: the 10% breathing room in the entry above is removed, and the crop is now
  tight to the glyph. Reported from a pixel-level comparison against Gmail's tile in the
  same Connectors list: Gmail's mark reached two screen pixels further out on each side.
  Measured on the shipped v0.19.2 icon, the ink sat at (23,41) to (492,473) inside 512x512,
  so 20 to 23 pixels of every edge were the breathing-room factor itself and nothing else,
  4% of the tile horizontally and 8% vertically on top of whatever padding the host draws.
  Breathing room is what a logo needs on a page, not what an icon needs inside a tile the
  host already pads. The bounding box is now taken at luminance > 16 rather than > 32, which
  keeps the two columns of anti-aliased falloff that a tighter threshold would have clipped;
  > 8 is too low to use, because the near-black background itself sits at luminance 13 and
  lights up the whole canvas. Squaring that box on its own centre gives 418, and the result
  fills 99.2% of the tile by 91.4%, against 91.6% by 84.4% before. The residual 0.4% left and
  right is the anti-aliasing and there is nothing further to take; the residual 4.3% top and
  bottom is the mark being wider than it is tall, which a square icon cannot remove without
  distorting it, and Gmail's mark has the same property. What this does NOT buy is the full
  two pixels: at an 18-pixel tile the margin removed is about 1.2 pixels of width in total.
  The rest is the stroke weight the entry above already recorded as a design decision, because
  the outermost pixel of a hairline lands at partial alpha and reads as absent, while the
  outermost pixel of a solid mark like Gmail's is fully opaque.

- 2026-08-15: the netlist import moves onto the substrate, which leaves no
  `pcbnew.SaveBoard` writing a user's own board anywhere in the package, and the two
  library upgrades are recorded as a PERMANENT exception rather than as work not yet
  done. Three subprocess writers become two, and the two that remain are the two that
  should. `_netlist_import.apply()` ended in `SaveBoard` on the user's file;
  `pcb._apply_netlist_cst` does the same work in-process and writes through
  `_atomic_write`, following `fill_zones`: a subprocess may compute, never write. Its
  structure mirrors `apply()` pass for pass so the two can be diffed. The only
  `SaveBoard` left writes autoroute's copy, which is a file the user did not have
  before. Four parts were genuinely new rather than a translation, each recorded
  because each is a place to be quietly wrong. A pad copied out of a `.kicad_mod`
  carries no `(net ...)` child at all, so binding inserts one after `(layers ...)`,
  where `_set_item_net` only ever mutated an atom that every track and via already
  has. There was no empty-board template in this package and `pcbnew.NewBoard` was the
  only way to make a board, so `_EMPTY_PCB_TPL` is 2081 bytes harvested from NewBoard
  itself and a test asserts the constant still equals that harvest. Net declaration
  and pruning are version-shaped: KiCad 9 carries a root table that numbers come from,
  KiCad 10 has none, so on 10 there is nothing to declare or prune and the counts
  report zero rather than inventing a number. And the placement anchor moves slightly,
  because pcbnew computed it from a bounding box including graphics and courtyards
  while a CST scan sees footprint origins; the tool promises a grid cluster and not a
  coordinate. The prerequisite was the footprint twin of
  `_copy_lib_symbol_from_file_cst`, whose absence is why this had stayed on pcbnew:
  `place_footprint` had been emitting a shell with no pads, no silkscreen and no
  courtyard, and a board of those cannot be routed or manufactured. That transform was
  harvested, not derived, against KiCad's own `multichannel_mixer-unrouted`, whose
  `Potentiometer_Alps_RK09K_Single_Vertical` is directly comparable with the stock
  library file at 17 `fp_line`, 5 `pad` and 1 `fp_circle` on both sides, so the
  geometry is identical and every remaining difference is the transform: the name atom
  gains its library prefix, `version`/`generator`/`generator_version` are dropped,
  `uuid` then `at` are inserted after `layer`, every uuid already in the file is
  regenerated, and each pad takes the footprint's angle in its own `at`. Two of those
  would have been wrong by inspection, since library footprints already carry uuids on
  properties and pads (29 per copy on the potentiometer, 0 on `R_0805`, so a test
  written against the resistor alone passes vacuously) and a rotated footprint whose
  pads kept the library angle draws correct copper at the wrong orientation. A third
  was found only by running it: the inserted root uuid kept the template's literal
  "x", every placement carried the same one, and kicad-cli loaded a board with two
  identical uuids at rc 0 without a word. Swept 15,415 stock footprints across 155
  libraries through the transform. The oracle for the import itself is the eight
  existing E2E tests, written against the pcbnew implementation and passing unchanged
  against this one, plus one assertion that could not exist before: a second import
  that changes nothing leaves the board BYTE-IDENTICAL. That E2E gate also loses its
  pcbnew term, because the tool no longer uses pcbnew and leaving it in would skip the
  whole class on a machine able to run every test in it; only `test_zone_fill_acceptance`
  keeps a pcbnew gate of its own. On the two library upgrades: closing them
  means reimplementing KiCad's own version-to-version migration in order to avoid
  letting KiCad perform it, and nothing is being preserved, because rewriting the file
  IS the operation the caller asked for. Recorded as permanent so it is not
  re-litigated. What was still open about them is now measured, and it is worse than
  assumed: both truncate in place rather than replacing. On KiCad 9 locally and on both
  KiCad 10.0.5 runners, `st_ino` was unchanged across the write and a concurrent reader
  caught a zero-byte read every time, with Windows catching 8 further partial sizes on
  `sym upgrade`. That is exactly the torn-write exposure `_atomic_write` exists to
  close, so the one bounded `.bak` each takes mitigates it and does not remove it. Also
  measured on that run, and the reason `run_drc` refills on KiCad 10: `pcb drc
  --refill-zones` without `--save-board` leaves the board byte-identical, with a
  control on the same board running `--save-board` and watching it gain
  `filled_polygon`, so the probe could tell "did not save" from "cannot see a save".
  Method note worth keeping, since it repeats the last probe's lesson: three faults in
  that probe were caught by running it locally first and all three would have produced
  confident wrong answers, `add_copper_zone` refusing a net the board does not carry,
  the stock libraries shipping read-only so a mode-preserving copy made kicad-cli exit
  2 with its error on STDOUT and stderr empty, and `fp upgrade` no-opping on a current
  library. A fourth was in the instrument, which counted any size change as a torn read
  when an upgrade legitimately changes the size. The first CI run then found a fifth,
  the footprint stamp hardcoded at KiCad 9's 20241229 when KiCad 10 ships 20260206, so
  the wind-back matched nothing and both platforms answered CANNOT-ANSWER for what read
  as a property of `fp upgrade`.

- 2026-08-15: the two library upgrades stop truncating the user's file, which narrows
  yesterday's PERMANENT ruling rather than overturning it. That entry was right that
  closing the BYTE PRESERVATION half would mean reimplementing KiCad's own
  version-to-version migration to avoid letting KiCad perform it, and that nothing is
  preserved anyway because rewriting the file is the operation the caller asked for.
  What it conceded without needing to was the other half. Atomicity is closable
  without reimplementing anything: `_upgrade_out_of_place` hands kicad-cli a scratch
  copy to truncate and lands the result through `_atomic_write`, so KiCad still
  performs the migration and the user's file is replaced whole or not at all. The
  ruling now reads: outside byte preservation permanently, inside atomicity. The
  reason this was cheap, and worth writing down because it is the thing that would
  have made it expensive: `_atomic_write` puts its temp file beside the target, so it
  can never cross a filesystem, which means nothing needs to be renamed out of the
  scratch directory at all. Bytes are read out and written through the existing
  helper. Moving a directory into place instead would have needed an atomic directory
  rename, which does not exist portably: `os.replace` refuses a non-empty directory on
  POSIX and will not replace a directory at all on Windows. Three things were measured
  first, each because it changes the code. An out-of-place upgrade is byte-identical
  to an in-place one, which the whole approach rests on and which is now pinned by a
  test rather than assumed. `fp upgrade` touches the mtime of every file in a library
  but changes the CONTENT of only the stale ones, so the comparison is on bytes and a
  file kicad-cli rewrote to identical content is not written here at all, which makes
  this quieter than the in-place version it replaces. And it does not require the
  directory to end in `.pretty`, though the scratch copy keeps the name anyway. The
  before and after, same instrument: previously st_ino was unchanged across the write
  and a concurrent reader caught a zero-byte read every time; now st_ino changes and
  the reader sees one distinct size and no torn read, on both tools. One Windows
  finding came out of running that instrument, and it is the designed behaviour rather
  than a defect: a reader that holds the file open continuously makes `os.replace`
  lose, because Windows will not replace a file another handle has open, and
  `_atomic_write` then retries for about 0.75 s and refuses with the file intact. The
  trade is a torn file for a clean refusal, which is the invariant. The instrument was
  the thing at fault there, since a real scanner does not read in a tight loop, and a
  1 ms gap lets the replace win. A no-op upgrade now writes nothing and says so, which
  matters because `sym upgrade` without `--force` correctly declines a current library
  and the tool used to report that as success. Three defects were found by reading and
  by testing the code around this, all fixed here. `_backup_for_external_write` deleted
  the old backup before installing the new one, leaving a window in which NO backup
  existed: the copy was complete and safe, but a crash between the delete and the
  rename took the previous good one with it. It now retires the old backup by rename
  and removes it after. Its `except OSError` also missed `shutil.Error`, which is not
  an OSError subclass and is what `copytree` raises when it aggregates per-file
  failures, so a partly-failed tree copy escaped as a raw traceback naming neither the
  tool nor the library. And `_atomic_write` copies the destination's mode onto its
  temp, so a read-only destination produced a read-only temp that Windows refused to
  unlink, and the cleanup then raised over the top of the real failure with a message
  naming the TEMP path, which is the one thing that function's own comment says never
  to do. Note that `test_every_write_goes_through_atomic_write` cannot see any of this:
  it scans for `.write_bytes` and `.write_text` and is blind to `copytree`, `copy2` and
  `os.replace`, so this design passes it without an exemption and without being checked
  by it. The tests gate on st_ino rather than on a torn-read count, because an atomic
  replace changes the inode and a truncate-and-rewrite does not, which is
  deterministic, while a torn-read count proves truncation when it fires and proves
  nothing when it misses. Pointing the helper back at an in-place `_run_cli` turns four
  red; replacing the two `_atomic_write` calls with a direct `write_bytes` turns the
  two st_ino tests red.

- 2026-10-02: `_atomic_write`'s temp gains a random part and an exclusive create. It
  is now named `<name>.<pid>.<8 hex>.tmp` (`board.kicad_sch.1234.ab12cd34.tmp` where
  the 2026-08-10 entry shows `board.kicad_sch.1234.tmp`); the suffix still follows the
  whole name, for the reason that entry gives. The pid alone gave every writer of one
  file in one process the same temp, and the temp was written with `write_bytes`,
  which truncates whatever sits at the name. It is now created with `open(tmp, "xb")`
  outside the cleanup's `try`, so a taken name raises and the file already there is
  left as it was. The destination's mode moves with `os.fchmod` on the open descriptor
  on Linux and macOS, where `shutil.copymode` went back through the path. Windows now
  carries no mode at all: its only one is read-only, and copying that is what made the
  read-only temp the 2026-08-15 entry describes, so the chmod-and-retry branch that
  entry added to the cleanup is deleted along with its cause. A read-only destination
  on Windows still fails the replace and is refused with the file intact, which
  `test_a_read_only_original_is_platform_shaped` pins.

- 2026-10-02: the footprint-library upgrade refuses a library it cannot copy safely.
  Both copies of a `.pretty`, the `.bak` beside it and the scratch copy kicad-cli
  upgrades, are `shutil.copytree`, which follows symlinks by default and recurses into
  Windows junctions on purpose (its own source says so). A link to a device such as
  `/dev/zero` would copy until the disk filled, and a link out of the library carries
  whatever it points at into the `.bak`. `_require_plain_tree` now walks the library
  first, follows nothing, and refuses by name any link, or anything that is neither a
  regular file nor a directory, before either copy starts; the root itself must be a
  real directory. Junctions count as links. Measured on Windows with Python 3.10.19, a
  junction reads as a plain directory to `S_ISLNK` and to `is_symlink()`, and only its
  reparse tag (`IO_REPARSE_TAG_MOUNT_POINT`) gives it away, which is the same test
  `shutil._rmtree_islink` applies. Before this change a symlinked footprint, a junction
  and a symlinked library root were all copied into a `.bak`, and a dangling link escaped the
  scratch copy as a raw `shutil.Error`. Two smaller fixes ride along. A tree copy that
  fails part way is now removed, where it used to stay beside the library as
  `<name>.bak.<pid>.tmp` with nothing to collect it. And `upgrade_footprint_lib`
  refuses a path that is not a directory before making a backup: given a `.kicad_mod`
  it used to write the `.bak` and then hand the file to kicad-cli 9.0.8, which answered
  "Output path must be specified to convert legacy and non-KiCad libraries". What the
  walk cannot close is a link created between the walk and the copy; the case it
  closes is a crafted library at rest.

- 2026-10-02: `place_component` refuses a symbol it cannot define, closing a gap that
  slice 10 carried over from the kiutils version unexamined. A placed symbol is a part
  only because its definition sits in `lib_symbols` beside it; the instance just points
  at it. The "not found" check ran only when a library file had been found, because it
  existed to suggest similar names, so a prefixed lib_id whose stock library was
  missing, a bare lib_id with no `symbol_lib_path`, and a bare lib_id whose library
  lacked the symbol all wrote the instance anyway and reported success. Measured with
  the stock lookup disabled: no definition, no pins, and `kicad-cli sch erc` at rc 0
  with no violations, because a pinless symbol gives ERC nothing to check. That blind
  spot is worth recording next to ADR-1's: loading proves only that KiCad could read
  the file, never that the edit was the one asked for. The second case was worse.
  12,127 of the stock symbols in a KiCad 9 install are derived, an `(extends "Parent")`
  plus properties with the pins left in the parent, and the copy took that stub
  verbatim; kicad-cli 9 then refused to load the whole schematic, and the same file
  loaded once the `(extends ...)` node was removed. No test had ever placed a derived
  symbol, so the oracle that would have caught it never saw one. KiCad embeds them
  flattened: the three KiCad 9 demo schematics that use a derived stock symbol carry
  the parent's pins and no `(extends ...)`, which is the harvest material ADR-2 asks
  for once flattening is built. Until then the copy refuses a stub and names the
  parent, which has the same pins. Refusing rather than building a definition follows
  ADR-2 directly: the pins exist only in a library, and an invented definition is
  exactly the hand-written construct it rules out. The check now runs on the result,
  after every load attempt and in the old position (after the reference and bounds
  refusals, before any write), and `add_power_symbol` and `auto_place_decoupling_cap`
  inherit it because they call `place_component` first. `_system_sym_dirs` is the one
  list both `_resolve_system_lib` and the refusal read, so the folders a refusal names
  are the folders searched, and both library reads go through `_open_sym_lib`, which
  turns a missing `symbol_lib_path` (a raw FileNotFoundError before) and a file that
  is not a library (an IndexError before) into ToolErrors. Seven tests had been passing
  on the KiCad-free CI legs only by writing orphans, measured by re-running the
  affected tests with KiCad hidden: six fast ones and the bundle round trip. One of
  them compared the pin UUIDs of a sheet and its duplicate, which for a pinless R7
  meant comparing two empty lists. They now take the definition from a stand-in stock
  folder, the `stock_symbol_dir` fixture behind `KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR`. The bundle test had
  a problem of its own: uv rebuilds a local directory dependency only when its
  `pyproject.toml` changes, so on a warm cache it ran a stale build of the package
  rather than the checkout, and it passed against the code this change replaced until
  `--reinstall-package` went into its command. Deliberately left out: flattening
  derived symbols, the next slice; `add_power_symbol` silently skipping its PWR_FLAG
  when the power library is missing, and writing the power symbol before the flag can
  fail, which belong to the PWR_FLAG rework; the ValueError `connect_pins` raises for a
  symbol with no definition, which the MCP SDK wraps exactly as it wraps a ToolError;
  and resolving a prefix through a project sym-lib-table, which the refusal now states
  plainly instead.

- 2026-10-02: `wire_pins_to_net` no longer places a PWR_FLAG, so it emits no symbol and
  copies no lib_symbols entry; its writes are wires, labels and junctions only, and the
  slice-8 placed template and synthetic lib template are deleted with it. The flag was
  decided per call, but whether a net needs one depends on every driver on the net, so
  on a net that already had a flag or a power output it added a second one, which ERC
  reports as "Pins of type Power output and Power output are connected" (measured on
  kicad-cli 9.0.8 with two flags on one net). The routing pressure test also measured
  kicad-cli ERC crashing (0xC0000005) when the auto flag's lib_id `power:PWR_FLAG`, with
  no lib_name, met an entry `add_power_symbol` had copied under the bare name. The
  verbatim system-library copy that this path used to exercise is still tested, now
  through `place_component`. `add_power_symbol` loses its own automatic flag for the
  same reason, plus a sharper one: a flag tells ERC the net has a source it cannot
  see, which only the designer knows, so placing one beside every power symbol marked
  every rail as driven and silenced the undriven-net check it exists to satisfy. It is
  now one `place_component` call, which also ends its two-write sequence (symbol, then
  flag) that could leave half the change on disk. Callers place a flag with
  `add_power_symbol` and lib_id `power:PWR_FLAG`, on the nets that need one.

- 2026-10-04: the netlist import carries what KiCad's own update carries, and
  footprint libraries are resolved through the `fp-lib-table` files KiCad reads. Until
  now `update_pcb_from_schematic` copied a footprint's Reference, Value, library id,
  path and pad nets and nothing else, so a board it built differed from one KiCad's
  F8 built in every field, every DNP and BOM flag and every sheet link, and a nickname
  that only the project's table knew was reported `footprint_lib_not_found`. Both
  halves were measured before they were written. The netlist side on kicad-cli 10.0.6:
  a component's `<fields>` always lists Footprint, Datasheet and Description, empty or
  not, plus the symbol's user fields; the three boxes arrive as value-less
  `<property name="dnp"/>`, `exclude_from_bom` and `exclude_from_board` markers written
  only when the box is ticked; the sheet is `<sheetpath names="/">` at the root plus a
  `Sheetfile` property. The board side on a footprint KiCad's own update wrote (the
  torque block's INA821, placed at 180 degrees): a user field lands as a hidden
  `(property ...)` on the footprint's F.Fab at `(at 0 0 180)`, which is the footprint's
  own angle (the first reading of this sample, "cancels the footprint's angle", was
  wrong: 180 is the one angle that cannot tell the two apart, and the second 2026-10-04
  entry below has the measurement that does), `(unlocked yes)`, which is Keep Upright OFF and
  not a free-rotation flag (the parser's own comment: "unlocked" is not the opposite of
  "locked"), size 1 by 1, thickness 0.15; Datasheet and Description are updated in
  place where the library footprint
  put them; `path`, `sheetname` and `sheetfile` follow the symbol; `(attr smd)` keeps
  the mounting type; the library's own KiLib_Generator field survives; Footprint is
  not a footprint field. `_FP_FIELD_TPL` is that measured node, `_ATTR_ORDER` is the
  writer's token order in pcb_io_kicad_sexpr.cpp, and `_SYMBOL_OWNED_ATTRS` names the
  two tokens the schematic owns on every netlist, so clearing a box clears the flag
  while `board_only` and `allow_missing_courtyard` stay the board's;
  `exclude_from_pos_files` is the board's on a KiCad 9 netlist and the symbol's on a
  KiCad 10 one (second 2026-10-04 entry). One decision is recorded so it is not re-litigated:
  a field that left the
  symbol is NOT removed from the footprint. KiCad itself keeps a footprint's library
  fields through its update, and a property the user placed by hand is text an import
  has no business deleting unasked; the cost is a stale field the user can delete,
  against the alternative of destroying placed text. A symbol with "On board" unticked
  is what KiCad's update treats as not on this board: never placed, listed in
  `excluded_from_board`, its pins skipped in the pad pass without a warning, and a
  footprint it left behind reported stale like any other. The oracle for DNP is KiCad,
  not the bytes: `kicad-cli pcb export pos --exclude-dnp` drops exactly the flagged
  footprint and keeps it again once the box is cleared. A first draft of that test
  asserted `b"dnp" not in raw` and failed on a board with every flag cleared, because
  the board's own setup carries `hidednponfab`, `sketchdnponfab` and `crossoutdnponfab`;
  the assertion now names the attribute. On libraries: `_fp_lib_tables` is the one
  reader of `fp-lib-table`, returning the project table and the global table apart
  because they sit at different points of the search. KiCad's order is the project's
  table, then the directories this package has always searched (`.pretty` beside the
  board and schematic, `KICAD_FP_LIB`), then the global table, then the stock
  footprints, and `place_footprint` now walks the same list so a hand-placed part and
  an imported one resolve to one file (the first cut did not quite: see the second 2026-10-04
  entry). Only rows the package can serve are returned:
  type KiCad, enabled, `${VAR}` expanded, directory present; `${KIPRJMOD}` is the
  `.kicad_pro`'s directory (`_project_dir`, falling back to the first of the board's
  and schematic's directories that holds a table or a project), every other variable
  comes from the environment first and then from the resolved kicad-cli's install for
  the `KICAD<N>_FOOTPRINT_DIR` family. Measured on KiCad 10.0.6: the global table under
  `~/.config/kicad/10.0/` is a single `(type "Table")` row pointing at
  `${KICAD10_TEMPLATE_DIR}/fp-lib-table`, whose 155 rows use `${KICAD10_FOOTPRINT_DIR}`,
  so the reader follows one level of `Table` rows (`_LIB_TABLE_DEPTH`). An unreadable
  or malformed table answers empty rather than failing the tool, since the table is a
  hint about where libraries live and not the operation itself, and the refusal still
  names every directory searched plus how many table rows named other libraries.
  Gates: the two fields E2E tests (new, edited and cleared, idempotent on the second
  run) and the table E2E test turn red without the three sync calls or the table
  lookup; a second import that changes nothing is still byte-identical.

- 2026-10-04, after review: the review of the entry above (upstream PR #67) against KiCad's source
  at 9.0.9 and 10.0.6 found the model right in its bones and wrong in four details,
  each re-measured here before the fix. (1) A new field takes the footprint's own
  angle, not its negation: KiCad's updater places the field at the footprint origin
  and calls `Rotate(fpPos, fpOrientation)`, and the writer stores the text's absolute
  board angle. Measured on a KiCad-written board: footprints at 90 carry their new
  fields at 90 and footprints at -90 at 270; the INA821 at 180 was the one sample that
  could not distinguish the two. `_sync_fp_fields` now writes `rotation % 360`.
  (2) `(unlocked yes)` is Keep Upright OFF, which is why the field turns with the
  footprint at all. (3) A new field on the back is mirrored: `StyleFromSettings` sets
  mirrored for a back layer (reached through the updater's `aCheckSide = true`), so
  the field's effects gain `(justify mirror)`, laid out under the font as the writer
  lays it out; measured with pcbnew 10.0.6 on a flipped footprint. (4) On KiCad 10 the
  schematic owns `exclude_from_pos_files` as well: the exporter writes an
  `exclude_from_pos_files` marker for a symbol with "Exclude from position files"
  ticked (measured: kicad-cli 10.0.6 on a symbol with `(in_pos_files no)`) and the
  updater sets and clears the flag from it, so a stock mounting hole, whose symbol is
  in position files and whose footprint is not, loses the flag under KiCad 10's F8.
  KiCad 9 writes no marker, so joining the token to `_SYMBOL_OWNED_ATTRS` outright
  would clear every library's flag there. `parse_netlist` therefore reads the netlist's
  own `<design><tool>` and answers a bool for KiCad 10 or later and None otherwise, and
  `_sync_fp_attributes` treats None as "the board's own". Also from the review: the
  import and `place_footprint` searched in different orders (the import's directory
  list ended with the stock footprints, so stock came before the global table there
  and after it in `place_footprint`; a global row shadowing a stock nickname resolved
  to two files). Both now go through `_FpLibResolver`, one non-raising resolver in
  the documented order that reads each table at most once and the global one only
  after the local lookups miss (about 15 ms per read of the stock table's 155 nested
  rows, measured by the reviewer). `_kicad_var` learned the two kinds of global row it
  dropped: variables from Preferences > Configure Paths, which KiCad keeps in
  `kicad_common.json` with the OS environment winning, and `${KICAD<N>_3RD_PARTY}`,
  whose default KiCad computes at run time (`<documents>/KiCad/<N>.0/3rdparty`, the
  folder `kicad` on Linux, with `KICAD_DOCUMENTS_HOME` standing in for `<documents>`)
  and never writes to the table; with it,
  `_pcm_footprint_libs` emulates the scan KiCad runs while loading the global table
  when `pcm.lib_auto_add` is on, adding `<package>/<lib>.pretty` as
  `<pcm.lib_prefix><lib>` under the file's own rows (KiCad's own scan is wider and
  stricter; the next entry matches it). Smaller corrections: `Component
  Class` joins the names the updater handles apart (KiCad assigns it as a component
  class, not a field; dropped here); the symbol's `ki_fp_filters` is copied as
  `(property ki_fp_filters "...")` just before `(path ...)`, where KiCad's writer puts
  it, and a new user field is inserted before it rather than after; `(sheetname ...)`,
  `(sheetfile ...)` and the filters are set to whatever the netlist says, an empty
  value removing the node as KiCad's writer leaves an empty one out; and
  `_sync_fp_attributes` compares the token set, so a hand-ordered `(attr ...)` is left
  alone and unreported until a flag changes. Still not applied: KiCad 10's variant
  overrides. Gate: the KiCad 9 `suite` job, which this round's test expectation
  (Device:R's Datasheet is `"~"` in KiCad 9's library, `""` in KiCad 10's; the test now
  compares against the exported netlist) had kept from running past its first assert.

- 2026-10-04, review follow-ups: what the review of the two entries above still asked
  for, made on top of the author's commits. The lint failure was one pyright error, the
  key type pyright inferred for `owned` in `_sync_fp_attributes`, now annotated. The
  default of `${KICAD<N>_3RD_PARTY}` lost a folder whenever `KICAD_DOCUMENTS_HOME` was
  set: `PATHS::getUserDocumentPath` appends `KICAD_PATH_STR` ("KiCad" on Windows and
  macOS, "kicad" elsewhere) after the override exactly as after the documents folder,
  and `_KICAD_PATH_STR` now mirrors it. That was measured as well as read, because
  `PGM_BASE::InitPgm` creates the folder as kicad-cli starts: `kicad-cli version` with
  `KICAD_DOCUMENTS_HOME=<docs>` created `<docs>/KiCad/9.0/3rdparty` on Windows (9.0.8)
  where the code computed `<docs>/9.0/3rdparty`, and that run is now a test on every
  runner with KiCad installed. On Windows the documents folder is the shell's, not
  `~/Documents`: KiCad's `GetDocumentsPath` is wxWidgets' `GetDocumentsDir`, which in
  the wx 3.2.8 a KiCad 9.0.8 install carries is `SHGetFolderPath(CSIDL_PERSONAL,
  SHGFP_TYPE_CURRENT)`, and that follows OneDrive folder backup and folder redirection;
  `_windows_documents_dir` makes the same call and falls back to `~/Documents`. On a
  machine with OneDrive folder backup on, the shell and PowerShell's
  `[Environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments')` both answer
  `%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive\Documents` where the code had `%USERPROFILE%\Documents`. The
  same machine sets `KICAD_DOCUMENTS_HOME` in the user's environment, and KiCad 9's own
  Preferences > Configure Paths shows `KICAD9_3RD_PARTY` as
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\KiCad\KiCad\9.0\3rdparty\`, which is what `_kicad_var` now computes;
  before these fixes it computed `%LOCALAPPDATA%\KiCad\9.0\3rdparty`. The PCM scan
  follows KiCad's traversers (`PCM_FP_LIB_TRAVERSER` at 9.0.9, `PCM_LIB_TRAVERSER` at
  10.0.6) instead of approximating them: a `.pretty` at any depth inside a package; a
  library whose unexpanded `${KICAD<N>_3RD_PARTY}/footprints/...` URI is already a row
  left as that row has it; a taken nickname numbered `_1`, `_2`; both checks counting
  disabled rows, which `_lib_table_rows` reads. The approximation had a false positive
  the review did not list: a PCM library the user had disabled still resolved here,
  under its `PCM_` nickname. KiCad 9 adds these rows in memory at every load and KiCad
  10 also saves the table, so "KiCad never writes these rows" held for 9 only. Gates:
  every new test failed against the code before its fix and passes after it, and the
  full suite on that machine (KiCad 9.0.8) is 1220 passed, 23 skipped, twenty of the
  skips KiCad 10 tests; the KiCad 10 legs run only in the macOS and Windows jobs, from
  a `ci/**` push.

- 2026-10-04: wire_pins_to_net's write path, rebuilt on a read-only model of the sheet
  (`_connectivity.py`; decision record docs/adr-routing-safety.md). It still writes once through
  `_atomic_write` and only adds wire and label nodes, and every refusal leaves the file
  byte-identical. It writes no junctions any more: one on an unsplit wire's interior cuts that
  wire in kicad-cli 9. The pin transform is fixed for every pin read, not only this tool's:
  `_transform_pin_pos` mirrored before it rotated, KiCad rotates first, so at rotation 90 or 270
  with a mirror, get_pin_positions, get_net_connections and the pin lookup behind connect_pins,
  no_connect_pin and remove_no_connect all computed the true pin reflected through the symbol
  origin. The slice-7 differential test above pinned the CST read to the kiutils one through
  rotation and mirror and passed throughout, because both used that transform: it proved
  agreement, not correctness. What catches it now compares with KiCad itself: a sweep of 12
  orientations judged by kicad-cli's netlist, and a model-versus-netlist differential that runs
  on whatever KiCad each CI runner carries. The tool also reads past the sheet it edits, and
  only reads: the project's other sheets, for the duplicate-reference check, each parsed only
  when its bytes can hold a sheet block or a reference the call asks about, and cached by a
  digest of its content. auto_place_decoupling_cap still writes the cap and each pin separately;
  when a pin is refused after the cap is on disk, it now says what is there and lists the calls
  that remove it, all but a library symbol it copied into lib_symbols, which it says stays.
