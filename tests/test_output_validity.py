"""No input may produce a file KiCad cannot open.

The invariant says an edit that cannot be done correctly is refused with the
file intact. `_atomic_write` delivers the durability half; this file is the
validity half's regression net.

The property, which generalises past the parameters known today:

    For every write tool and every scalar parameter, a hostile value either
    raises ToolError, or produces a file kicad-cli can still load. Never a
    third outcome.

The third outcome is what shipped. Measured 2026-08-12: `add_trace(layer=
"banana")` wrote `(layer banana)` and the board then failed to load, and
`place_component(rotation=37)` did the same to a schematic. Both were accepted
silently by every test in the suite.

Two things make this test worth its runtime rather than decorative:

* **The baseline must succeed.** Every case first runs the unmutated call and
  fails loudly if it does not. Without that, a tool erroring for some unrelated
  reason makes every hostile value "refused" and the whole sweep passes while
  measuring nothing. That vacuity is the trap this sweep exists to avoid, so it
  is asserted rather than assumed.
* **Accepted is not the same as wrong.** A footprint at 37 degrees is legal
  KiCad, so the check is refused-or-valid, not refused. Anything a hostile
  value writes is run through the same `kicad-cli` oracle the rest of the suite
  uses, inline rather than at teardown so the failure names the parameter.

Proven non-vacuous 2026-08-12 by removing the layer guard from `add_trace` and
confirming the sweep goes red. Whole file runs in about 10s.

It earned that on its first run: `add_global_label(shape=...)` was unvalidated
while `add_hierarchical_label` had always checked the same vocabulary, so a
bad shape reached the file and kicad-cli refused the schematic.

Deliberately not a hardcoded list of *parameters*: a name-scoped guard is what
let mirror, output_units, layer and rotation through, in that order. The
parameters come from the live signature, so a new one is swept the day it is
added. The tools are listed, and `test_every_constrained_writer_is_swept` fails
when a write tool that takes one of these parameter names is not.
