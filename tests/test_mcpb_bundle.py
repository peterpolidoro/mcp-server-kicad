"""Drive the MCPB bundle the way a desktop host does: as a subprocess over stdio.

Everything else in this suite imports the tools and calls them. That never
exercises the layer the bundle actually is, and every MCPB defect so far has
lived there rather than in tool logic: an unset config field arriving as the
literal string ``${user_config.kicad_cli_path}``, a temp directory getting
packed into the archive, a manifest whose version was stamped wrong.

Deliberately not a mock. The point is a real ``uv run`` against the real
manifest, so what runs here is what a host runs.

Skipped unless uv is installed, and slow: uv builds a fresh environment.
