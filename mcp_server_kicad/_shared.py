    ``sym upgrade`` and ``fp upgrade`` truncate the user's file and write it
    again, which is the exposure `_atomic_write` exists to close. Measured on
    KiCad 9 locally and on both KiCad 10.0.5 runners: ``st_ino`` unchanged
    across the write, and a concurrent reader caught a zero-byte read every
    time, with Windows catching 8 further partial sizes on ``sym upgrade``.

    Nothing here reimplements the migration, which is KiCad's to do and the
    reason these two tools exist. kicad-cli still performs it; it just performs
    it on a copy, and the result lands through `_atomic_write`, so the user's
    file is replaced whole or not at all.

    The scratch directory can be the system temp because nothing is renamed
    across it: bytes are read out and handed to `_atomic_write`, whose own temp
    is a sibling of the real target and therefore never crosses a filesystem.
    That is what makes this cheap. Moving a directory into place instead would
    have needed an atomic directory rename, which does not exist portably.

    Measured 2026-08-15 before writing this, because each answer changes the
    code: an out-of-place upgrade is byte-identical to an in-place one (the
    whole approach rests on that); ``fp upgrade`` touches the mtime of every
    file in a library but changes the CONTENT only of the stale ones, which is
    why the comparison below is on bytes and why a file kicad-cli rewrote to
    the same content keeps its mtime here; and it does not require the
    directory to end in ``.pretty``, though the copy keeps the name anyway.

    Per-file atomicity, not library-level. A crash midway through a .pretty
    leaves some footprints upgraded and some not, with no file torn. That is
    the same boundary the ADR already draws for fan-out writes.

    its children's local coordinates, so what the file holds for a ``B.Cu``
    footprint is already in the flipped frame and needs no further mirroring.
