# mcp-server-kicad

**Let an AI assistant edit real KiCad projects without corrupting them.**

109 MCP tools covering schematic capture, PCB layout, symbol and footprint
libraries, ERC and DRC, and manufacturing exports. No screenshots, no
copy-paste, no hand-edited s-expressions: the model calls tools, KiCad files
change on disk.

## What it looks like

```text
"Add a 100 nF decoupling cap on U1's VCC pin, then check ERC."

  get_pin_positions            locate U1's VCC and GND pins
  auto_place_decoupling_cap    place C3, wire it, drop the junctions
  run_erc                      report what the change broke

"Now push the netlist to the board and route it."

  update_pcb_from_schematic    sync footprints and pad nets onto the PCB
  autoroute_pcb                route with Freerouting
  run_drc                      clearance, width, and unconnected checks
```

Every tool works on the real file. Writes go through a byte-preserving
substrate, so bytes you did not ask to change reach the disk unchanged, and an
edit that cannot be done correctly is refused with the file intact. That now
covers every edit this server makes to a board or schematic. KiCad itself
writes a design file in only two places: the library upgrades, which say so on
themselves, and `autoroute_pcb`'s routed copy, a new board that `pcbnew` saves
while yours stays untouched.

## Quick start

### Claude Code

Install the plugin. It wires up the server and ships the design skills with it:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ProductOfAmerica/mcp-server-kicad
claude plugin install kicad
```

### Claude Desktop

Download `kicad-<version>.mcpb` from the [latest release][latest] and install it
from Settings, then Extensions. Claude Desktop fetches Python and the package
itself, so KiCad is the only thing you need installed first.

Fill in the schematic, board, and export paths it asks for. Unlike the Claude
Code plugin, Desktop does not run from your project directory, so nothing is
auto-detected. Leave the `kicad-cli` field blank unless KiCad lives somewhere
unusual; stock installs are found on their own, on every platform. The design
skills are Claude Code only.

[latest]: https://github.com/ProductOfAmerica/mcp-server-kicad/releases/latest

### Everything else

```bash
pip install mcp-server-kicad
```

Then point your MCP client at the unified server and set `cwd` to a KiCad
project directory so paths resolve themselves:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kicad": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "mcp-server-kicad", "mcp-server-kicad"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/kicad/project"
    }
  }
}
```

That single entry registers all 109 tools. Prefer to split them across five
smaller servers? See [Configuration](#configuration).

## What you get

### Five tool servers

Run them as one unified server, or separately when you want a smaller tool
surface in context.

| Server | Tools | What it does |
|--------|:-----:|--------------|
| `mcp-server-kicad-schematic` | 42 | Schematic read/write, net tracing, ERC, exports (PDF, SVG, DXF, netlist, BOM) |
| `mcp-server-kicad-pcb` | 34 | Board read/write, netlist import, zones, DRC, autorouting, exports (Gerber, drill, 3D, pick-and-place) |
| `mcp-server-kicad-project` | 24 | Project scaffolding, hierarchical sheets, hierarchy validation, annotation, cross-sheet net tracing |
| `mcp-server-kicad-symbol` | 5 | Symbol library browsing, authoring, SVG export, format upgrade |
| `mcp-server-kicad-footprint` | 4 | Footprint library browsing, SVG export, format upgrade |

### Six design skills (Claude Code plugin)

Tools alone let a model click every button. The bundled skills teach it which
buttons, in what order, and what "done" looks like.

| Skill | Kicks in when |
|-------|---------------|
| [`using-kicad`](skills/using-kicad/SKILL.md) | Any electronics or EDA conversation starts. Routes to the right skill below |
| [`circuit-design`](skills/circuit-design/SKILL.md) | Choosing topology, regulators, and component values, before any file exists |
| [`schematic-plan`](skills/schematic-plan/SKILL.md) | Planning exact placement coordinates and wiring. Pure planning, no writes |
| [`schematic-design`](skills/schematic-design/SKILL.md) | Executing that plan, or modifying an existing schematic |
| [`pcb-layout`](skills/pcb-layout/SKILL.md) | Placing footprints, routing, zones, stackup, trace widths |
| [`verification`](skills/verification/SKILL.md) | ERC and DRC failures, unconnected nets, export prep |

The design skills hand their artifacts to independent reviewer subagents
([`agents/`](agents/)) before moving on, so a bad BOM or a bad placement plan
gets caught before it becomes a schematic.

## Configuration

### Split servers

Five entries instead of one, when you want to load only part of the tool
surface:

<details>
<summary><b>Five-server MCP config</b></summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kicad-schematic": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "mcp-server-kicad", "mcp-server-kicad-schematic"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/kicad/project"
    },
    "kicad-pcb": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "mcp-server-kicad", "mcp-server-kicad-pcb"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/kicad/project"
    },
    "kicad-symbol": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "mcp-server-kicad", "mcp-server-kicad-symbol"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/kicad/project"
    },
    "kicad-footprint": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "mcp-server-kicad", "mcp-server-kicad-footprint"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/kicad/project"
    },
    "kicad-project": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "mcp-server-kicad", "mcp-server-kicad-project"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/kicad/project"
    }
  }
}
```

Each is also runnable directly:

```bash
uvx --from mcp-server-kicad mcp-server-kicad-schematic
```

</details>

### How paths resolve

Highest priority wins:

1. **Tool parameters.** Every tool accepts an explicit path.
2. **Environment variables.** They override anything auto-detected.
3. **Auto-detect.** The working directory is scanned for a `.kicad_pro`, and
   the schematic, board, and library paths are derived from it.

| Variable | Points at |
|----------|-----------|
| `KICAD_SCH_PATH` | a `.kicad_sch` schematic file |
| `KICAD_PCB_PATH` | a `.kicad_pcb` board file |
| `KICAD_SYM_LIB` | a `.kicad_sym` symbol library file |
| `KICAD_FP_LIB` | a `.pretty` footprint library directory |
| `KICAD_OUTPUT_DIR` | where exports and reports are written |

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- **KiCad 9.x or 10.x**, for the tools that hand work to KiCad. ERC, DRC, every
  export, jobsets, `get_version`, the library upgrades and
  `update_pcb_from_schematic` run `kicad-cli`; `fill_zones` and `autoroute_pcb`
  need KiCad's `pcbnew` Python bindings, and `autoroute_pcb` needs Java too.
  Placing a part from KiCad's stock symbol or footprint libraries needs those
  libraries, which come with KiCad. Every other read and write tool parses files
  directly and needs no KiCad install.

CI runs the full suite on Linux against KiCad 9 and on macOS and Windows against
KiCad 10, plus a KiCad-free matrix across Python 3.10 through 3.14.

### Finding your KiCad install

`kicad-cli` is looked up on `PATH`, then inside `/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app`
on macOS, then in the standard Windows install folders, machine-wide under
`Program Files` and per-user under `AppData`, newest version first. Neither
installer adds it to `PATH`. Everything else in the KiCad tree is located
relative to it, the same way KiCad itself does it, so a stock install on any
platform needs no configuration: the stock symbol libraries and the bundled
Python that provides `pcbnew` are both found automatically.

Override any of it if your install is unusual:

| Variable | Overrides |
|----------|-----------|
| `KICAD_CLI_PATH` | the `kicad-cli` executable, and everything derived from its location |
| `KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR` | the directory holding the stock `.kicad_sym` libraries |
| `KICAD_PYTHON` | the interpreter used for `pcbnew` (`fill_zones`, `autoroute_pcb`) |

CLI-backed tools are always registered. Without `kicad-cli` they fail with a
message naming `KICAD_CLI_PATH`, rather than vanishing from the tool list.

### KiCad 10 files

| File | What works today |
|------|------------------|
| `.kicad_sch` | Everything, read and write: the whole schematic server and the whole project server |
| `.kicad_pcb` | Everything, read and write |
| `.kicad_sym`, `.kicad_mod` | Everything: your own libraries as well as the stock ones |

Every tool parses and edits through the byte-preserving substrate, so the
server's own reads and writes refuse no file on its format version, and none of
them rewrites bytes you did not ask to change. What a tool hands to KiCad
itself, through `kicad-cli` or `pcbnew`, only works if your install can load the
file, and a KiCad 9 install cannot load a KiCad 10 board. Two caveats are worth
knowing about.

`autoroute_pcb` and `fill_zones` both need a `pcbnew` that can load the board:
autoroute uses one for the DSN export and the SES import, and `fill_zones` uses
one to compute the fills. Both check before they start. A KiCad 10 board on a
KiCad 9 `pcbnew` is refused with a message naming both versions; install KiCad
10 or point `KICAD_PYTHON` at one. In the other direction `autoroute_pcb` runs
and warns, because the routed copy comes back in the KiCad 10 format. Your
original board is untouched by autoroute either way, since it writes a copy.

`upgrade_symbol_lib` and `upgrade_footprint_lib` are the one place KiCad still
rewrites your file, because changing the format is exactly what you asked for.
It rewrites a copy: the result is moved into place atomically, so a library
can never be left half-written, and only files whose content actually changed
are touched. Each file is atomic; the library as a whole is not a transaction,
so an interrupted upgrade leaves some footprints migrated and none damaged. A
backup is still taken at `<name>.bak`, overwritten every run, because that is
the undo for an upgrade that worked.

`fill_zones` and `update_pcb_from_schematic` also used to be listed here for
letting `pcbnew` rewrite your board, and no longer do. `fill_zones` still asks
`pcbnew` to compute the fills, because nothing else can, but `pcbnew` only
reads: the copper comes back as coordinates and the substrate splices it in.
`update_pcb_from_schematic` no longer uses `pcbnew` at all. Both leave
everything they were not asked to change byte-identical, including the format
stamp. The design behind the substrate is written up in
[docs/adr-cst-substrate.md](docs/adr-cst-substrate.md).

### Windows: Controlled Folder Access

Windows Defender's ransomware protection, Controlled Folder Access, guards your
Documents folder and blocks writes from applications it does not recognise.
KiCad keeps its own data there, a 3D cache and templates under `Documents\KiCad`,
so a blocked write kills `kicad-cli` at startup with an access violation (exit
`3221225477`) before it does any work. Every invocation fails, `--version`
included.

The block surfaces as `error 2: The system cannot find the file specified`,
which is why this reads like a missing folder rather than a permission problem.
Measured on a machine with the feature on: the folder is plainly there and a
write into it still fails with `FileNotFoundError`.

`kicad-cli` is handled for you. On that crash the server retries once with
KiCad's own `KICAD_DOCUMENTS_HOME` pointed at a local folder outside the
protected set, then reuses it for the session. Nothing to configure, and a
machine without the block never sees any of it. Setting `KICAD_DOCUMENTS_HOME`
yourself picks the folder and disables the retry, on the grounds that a
directory you chose is yours to fix.

**Your project files are a separate matter.** The same block applies to any
write, so if your KiCad project lives under Documents, the write tools can fail
the same confusing way, and the server cannot repair that: it is the location
you asked it to edit. Either keep projects outside the protected folders, or
allow the tools through at Windows Security, Virus & threat protection,
Ransomware protection, Allow an app through Controlled folder access.
